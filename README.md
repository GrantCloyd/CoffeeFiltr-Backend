## Setup

Clone down this repository. A basic Rack app is located in the backend folder.

First, cd into the backend folder and run bundle install in your backend folder to install your gems.

Start your server with:

shotgun --port=9292
Note: This will run your server on port http://localhost:9292. shotgun is a ruby gem that will automatically reload your Rack server. You may still need to refresh your browser to see changes.
